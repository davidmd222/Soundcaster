## Farcaster Frames Hackathon 🏆💻

### Problem Statement ❓🔊

Farcaster lacks support for audio functionalities, limiting users' ability to engage with sound-related content, such as music streaming. This gap hinders the platform's appeal and usability for users interested in audio-based experiences.

### Proposed Solution 💡🎶

Develop a minimalist MVP client, "Soundcaster," leveraging Farcaster's infrastructure to enable basic audio streaming functionalities. Users can upload audio files, and Soundcaster provides a simple timeline interface for scrolling through and playing these files.

### MVP 🥇✨

- **Basic Audio Streaming**: Enable users to upload audio files to Farcaster and stream them through Soundcaster.
- **Timeline Interface**: Implement a minimalist timeline interface for users to scroll through uploaded audio files and play them.
- **Integration with Farcaster**: Demonstrate audio streaming capabilities within Farcaster's decentralized network, showcasing the platform's potential for supporting sound-related content.

By delivering this MVP, Soundcaster showcases Farcaster's ability to support audio streaming, laying the foundation for future iterations with expanded features and functionalities.
